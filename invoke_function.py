'''
To use a function, you call it. When you call a function, you must provide values, or arguments, for each of the functionâ€™s parameters.
Functions allow you to write code efficiently. When you need to perform an action more than once, wrap that code in a function and call it when you need it. 
When you need to change how the action is carried out, you can change the code in the function, and the improvement is applied everywhere.
